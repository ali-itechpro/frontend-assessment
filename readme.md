Please download the Solution folder then run the index.html

- Excercise 1 & 2 completed on the index.html page, details provided by using comments in html code for both the excercise.

Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

- When we remove .toLowerCase() and then run this ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a') we get the result - baNaNa.
- N is appearing in capital letter, basically it is displaying like this ba NaN a, here NaN stands for 'Not a Number'. NaN is a error, trying to return Number but couln't return it because second '+' sign is arthmetic operator is concatinating with string 'a'. Therefore, In place of + 'a' NaN is appearing.

Thanks
